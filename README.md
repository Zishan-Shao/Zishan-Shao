- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zishan-Shao (You can call me Bruce, I know it's hard to pronounce this)
- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning method and Computer Vision techniques in image processing and object detection; applying parallel approach to reduce communication costs for kernelized algorithms computing sparse matrices with OpenMPI, mkl_spblas, mkl_lapacke, cblas, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, C, Parallel Computing, Kernelized Ridge Regression, SVM, Partitioned Local Depth, CNN, R-CNN, Histogram of Gradient, SIFT, LBP, sparse matrices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any topics about topics listed up, hopefully the application of above approaches
